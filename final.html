  <h1> Here are some projects and pieces of art that I am proud to share with everyone!</h1>
  <p> On the left column, I added some pictures of art pieces that I completed for my AP Art Studio portfolio. My concentration for the portfolio was oxymorons. The first picture is called "Free Love" and the second picture is called "A Penny For Your Thoughts". Each piece consisted of hundreds of small dots from a pen to portray an image!

  <p> Moving on to Web specific material, this semester we have been faced with a lot of challenges that I am very pleased to share with you all! Below I will add links to all of my projects.</p>

  <p><b><span style="color: #FF4E50">Encyclopedia Page:</span></b> For this assignment, I created a page that looks like a Wikipedia page on Pickles. Click <a href="https://caitlinmullenix.github.io/assignments/assignment3.html" >here</a> to view the completed assignment! <p>
  <p><b><span style="color: #FF4E50">Design Challenges:</span></b>For this assignment, I created a page that consisted of multiple challenges. The first challenge was to build a chessboard, the second challenge was to create a form, and the third challenge was to create a Google search page. Click <a href="https://caitlinmullenix.github.io/assignments/assignment5.html" >here</a> to view the completed assignment!</p>
  <p><b><span style="color: #FF4E50">Website Wireframe:</span></b> Before completing this website, we were asked to create a website wireframe to outline how we wanted our website to look and operate! To take a peak at the beginning stage, click <a href="https://caitlinmullenix.github.io/wireframe.html" >here</a>!</p>

      <div class="text">I was presented with the challenege to recreate a Chuck Close portrait of myself. Chuck Close is known for creating portraits of people by using a grid method. By using shapes and colors, Close portrays portraits in a way that no one sees a face! This piece required some colored pencils and a lot of patience</div>

  <div class="text1">
  <p>For one of my final courses at CU Boulder, we were assigned to create a new brand and design a product with it. For my project, I decided to create a tequila brand and called it "CLM Tequila". I named it CLM because my name is Caitlin and my sisters names are Lauren and Morgan. Growing up “we were the 3 best friends that anyone could have” but that drove my parents insane. We were monsters.

  But, now that we are all adults, we look back on our monster days and drink about it while laughing and remincising. With the help of this tequila, my sisters and I are hoping to help all of you bring back your inner child. This project required Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

    <p>This project was to create an accordian book from lyrics from a song or poem. I chose to do the lyrics to the song 'Crush' by The Dave Matthews Band. By using the words and other graphics, I tried to portray how I envision the song to look like! This assignment required Adobe Illustrator. </p>
