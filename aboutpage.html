  <h2>About Me!</h2>
  <p class="first"> Every year before moving out to Colorado, for as long as I can remember, my family and I would travel to the mountains and spend many summers and winters there. We would have the best time hiking, white water rafting, and other outdoor activities that can’t be done in St. Louis, Missouri. So when it was time for me to start my college career, CU Boulder made the most sense to me. My mom is originally from Boulder herself and our family always reminisces on their time. CU Boulder has been such a wonderful experience thus far and I can’t wait to see what next year has in store for me!</p>
  <p class="second">Living in Colorado has really opened up a lot of expereinces for me. I love being outside, whenever the temperature reaches about 50 degrees, I will most likely be outside enjoying the blue skies and sunshine. I love to also ski whenever I have the chance to! Along with all of that, I am really passionate about art and design!</p>
