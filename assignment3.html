      <h1> Hi guys! </h1>
      <h2> My name is Caitlin Mullenix and my pronouns are she, her, and hers. </h2>
      <p> My goal for this course is to become comfortable enough with creating websites that I can use to show my skills and cretaivity to companies that are looking for those requirements.</p>
      <p> I am from St. Louis, Missouri originally but my family moved out to Colorado during my freshman year at CU Boulder. I am now currently a senior! I love going on long drives through different mountain ranges and enjoy adventures with my friends!</p>
      <p> Some more about me is that I love to listen to music. On the Spotify wrapped that came out it said I listened to a total of 91,849 minutes of music. That is equivlant to 63 days!</p>
