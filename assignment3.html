      <h1>Pickles</h1><hr>
      <p> A pickled cucumber (commonly known as a pickle in the United States and Canada, and a gherkin in Britain, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand) is a cucumber that has been pickled in a brine, vinegar, or other solution and left to ferment for a period of time, by either immersing the cucumbers in an acidic solution or through souring by lacto-fermentation. Pickled cucumbers are often part of mixed pickles.</p>

      <h2 id="History-Section">History</h2><hr>
      <p> It is often claimed that pickled cucumbers were first developed for workers building the Great Wall of China, though another hypothesis is that they were first made in the Tigris Valley of Mesopotamia, using cucumbers brought originally from India.</p>

      <h2 id="Types">Types of Pickles</h2><hr>

      <h3>Brined Pickles</h3>
      <p>Brined pickles are prepared using the traditional process of natural fermentation in a brine which makes them grow sour.[3] The brine concentration can vary between 20 and more than 40 grams of salt per litre of water (3.2–6.4 oz/imp gal or 2.7–5.3 oz/US gal). Vinegar is not needed in the brine of naturally fermented pickled cucumbers.</p>

      <h3>Bread and Butter</h3>
      <p>Bread-and-butter pickles are a marinated variety of pickled cucumber in a solution of vinegar, sugar, and spices. They may simply be chilled as refrigerator pickles or canned. Their name and their broad popularity in the United States are attributed to Omar and Cora Fanning, who were Illinois cucumber farmers that started selling sweet and sour pickles in the 1920s. They filed for the trademark "Fanning's Bread and Butter Pickles" in 1923 (though the recipe and similar recipes are probably much older).[4] The story to the name is that the Fannings survived rough years by making the pickles with their surplus of undersized cucumbers and bartering them with their grocer for staples such as bread and butter.[5] Their taste is often much sweeter than other types of pickle, due to the sweeter brine they are marinated in, but they differ from sweet pickles in that they are spiced with coriander and other spices.</p>

      <h3>Gherkin</h3>
      <p>Gherkins, or baby pickles, are small cucumbers, typically those 1 to 5 inches (3 to 13 cm) in length, often with bumpy skin, which are typically used for pickling.[6][7][8] The word gherkin comes from early modern Dutch, gurken or augurken for "small pickled cucumber".</p>

      <h3>Kosher dill</h3>
      <p>A "kosher" dill pickle is not necessarily kosher in the sense that it has been prepared in accordance with Jewish dietary law. Rather, it is a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, with generous addition of garlic and dill to a natural salt brine.In New York terminology, a "full-sour" kosher dill is one that has fully fermented, while a "half-sour", given a shorter stay in the brine, is still crisp and bright green.[19] Elsewhere, these pickles may sometimes be termed "old" and "new" dills.Dill pickles (not necessarily described as "kosher") have been served in New York City since at least 1899.</p>

      <h3>Kool-Aid pickles</h3>
      <p> Kool-Aid pickles or "koolickles", enjoyed by children in parts of the Southern United States, are created by soaking dill pickles in a mixture of Kool-Aid and pickle brine. </p>

      <h2 id="Nutrition">Nutrition</h2><hr>
      <p>Like pickled vegetables such as sauerkraut, sour pickled cucumbers (technically a fruit) are low in calories. They also contain a moderate amount of vitamin K, specifically in the form of K1. 30-gram sour pickled cucumber offers 12–16 µg, or approximately 15–20% of the Recommended Daily Allowance, of vitamin K. It also offers 3 kilocalories (13 kJ), most of which come from carbohydrate.[24] However, most sour pickled cucumbers are also high in sodium; one pickled cucumber can contain 350–500 mg, or 15–20% of the American recommended daily limit of 2400 mg.</p>

      <h2 id="Serving">Serving</h2><hr>
      <p>In the United States, pickles are often served as a side dish accompanying meals. This often takes the form of a "pickle spear", which is a pickled cucumber cut lengthwise into quarters or sixths. Pickles may be used as a condiment on a hamburger or other sandwich (usually in slice form), or on a sausage or hot dog in chopped form as pickle relish.</p>

      <h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2><hr>
      <p>The term pickle is derived from the Dutch word pekel, meaning brine.[32] In the United States and Canada, the word pickle alone refers to a pickled cucumber (other types of pickles will be described as "pickled onion", "pickled beets", etc.). In the UK pickle generally refers to a style of sweet, vinegary chutneys, such as Branston pickle, commonly served with a ploughman's lunch.</p>
