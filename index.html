      <h1> Hi there! </h1>
      <h2> My name is Caitlin Mullenix. </h2>
      <p> My goal for this course is to become comfortable enough with creating websites that I can use to show my skills and cretaivity to companies that are looking for those requirements.</p>
      <p> Originally from St. Louis, Missouri and currently living in Boulder, Colorado.
        I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder and I am majoring in Strategic Communications with an emphasis in Advertising.
        I am also completing a minor in Creative Technology and Design.</p>
      <p> Some more about me is that I love to listen to music. On the Spotify wrapped that came out it said I listened to a total of 91,849 minutes of music. That is equivlant to 63 days!</p>
