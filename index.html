      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> My name is Caitlin Mullenix and my pronouns are she, her, hers.</p>
      <p> My goal for this course is to become comfortable enough with creating websites that I can use to show my skills and cretaivity to companies that are looking for those requirements.</p>
      <p> I am from St. Louis, Missouri originally but my family moved out to Colorado during my freshman year at CU Boulder. I am now currently a senior! I love going on long drives through different mountain ranges and enjoy adventures with my friends!</p>
