  <h1> Here are some projects and pieces of art that I am proud to share with everyone!</h1>
  <p> On the left column, I added some pictures of art pieces that I completed for my AP Art Studio portfolio. My concentration for the portfolio was oxymorons. The first picture is called "Free Love" and the second picture is called "A Penny For Your Thoughts". Each piece consisted of hundreds of small dots from a pen to portray an image!

  <p> Moving on to Web specific material, this semester we have been faced with a lot of challenges that I am very pleased to share with you all! Below I will add links to all of my projects.</p>

  <p><b>Encyclopedia Page:</b> For this assignment, I created a page that looks like a Wikipedia page on Pickles. Click <a href="https://caitlinmullenix.github.io/assignments/assignment3.html" >here</a> to view the completed assignment! <p>
  <p><b>Design Challenges:</b> For this assignment, I created a page that consisted of multiple challenges. The first challenge was to build a chessboard, the second challenge was to create a form, and the third challenge was to create a Google search page. Click <a href="https://caitlinmullenix.github.io/assignments/assignment5.html" >here</a> to view the completed assignment!</p>
  <p><b>Website Wireframe:</b> Before completing this website, we were asked to create a website wireframe to outline how we wanted our website to look and operate! To take a peak at the beginning stage, click <a href="https://caitlinmullenix.github.io/wireframe.html" >here</a>!</p>
