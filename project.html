  <p> On the left column, I added some pictures of art pieces that I completed for my AP Art Studio portfolio. My concentration for the portfolio was oxymorons. The first picture is called "Free Love" and the second picture is called "A Penny For Your Thoughts". Each piece consisted of hundreds of small dots from a pen to portray an image!

  <p> Moving on to Web specific material, this semester we have been faced with a lot of challenges that I am very pleased to share with you all! Below I will add links to all of my projects.</p>
